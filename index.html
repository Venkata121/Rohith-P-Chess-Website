            Hi! I’m Venkata Pullabhotla, a sophomore at Brandeis High School. I became interested in chess at the age of
            nine when I saw two teens playing chess at a park in India. The oddly shaped pieces, large checkerboard, and
            competitive atmosphere immediately captivated me. I eagerly picked it up as one of my many hobbies and
            started off my long journey by learning how to move the pieces in Medavakkam, Chennai…
          </p>
          <p class="lead text-left">Five years after the incident, I can proudly say that I do not regret my decision to
            pursue chess. Throughout my short career, I have not only increased my self-esteem as a decent chess player,
            but have also learned how to utilize my time wisely, deal with stress, and be patient. Simultaneously, I
            have improved my creativity, problem-solving skills, and pattern recognition. To put it clearly, the
            benefits of chess are scientifically proven and go way beyond the chessboard. There is clear scientific
            evidence pointing to increased academic achievement, improved reading skills, and even an increase in the IQ
            of people, especially kids, who play chess.

      <p>Since I feel like chess has positively affected me and many other chess players in a multitude of ways, I would
        like to expose more kids to the game. <br>
        To do this, I will be hosting free chess classes and paid chess classes every weekend. Learn what’s being taught
        by clicking the button below!

      <p class="lead">Free group chess classes every weekend over Zoom beginning September 12. These
        comprehensive classes are 45 minutes - 1 hour in length and are designed to provide students with the basic
        background for major chess concepts.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Paid Chess Lessons</h1>
      <p class="lead">Individual chess lessons for players at the tournament level.
      </p>
      <hr class="my-2">
      <p>In these lessons, I will strive to teach the students in a more personalized way. Since kids who are in this
        stage of the curriculum should be willing to play in tournaments, I will give them special preparation that is
        unique to their style of play. If they have not already done so, I will choose an opening that fits them well
        and teach them the theory in that position in the form of live instruction and files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, these personalized lessons will go at the pace of the student. There will be no specific schedule or
        curriculum for these classes. Instead, they will fix their specific weaknesses and learn content (such as
        openings) that they prefer. Before tournaments, they might be given a little bit of extra practice so they can
        be as successful as possible.
      </p>
      <strong>The starting price for these lessons will be $15.
